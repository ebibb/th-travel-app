# Travel App

This Flask app allows users to search for travel locations, make posts about their favorite places, and browse posts from others with similar demographic profiles. It uses an API to fetch travel information and integrates user profiles for personalized recommendations. The structure follows standard Flask conventions with properly managed static files and templates.
